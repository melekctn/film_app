Movie Tracking and Chatbot-Supported Web Application

This project is a movie tracking system that allows users to manage a list of movies they want to watch, along with their statuses (Watched, To Be Watched, In Progress) and ratings. The application is built using PHP and MySQL for server-side processing and features a user-friendly interface created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A user authentication system is implemented, enabling each user to manage their personalized movie list. Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) has been developed to allow users to add, view, edit, and delete movie records from the database. A search functionality is included so users can quickly filter and find movies by title.

To enhance user interaction, a chatbot powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 has been integrated into the application. Users can interact with the chatbot to get movie recommendations or simply chat. This integration is implemented via the fetch API and PHP, making use of the OpenAI API.

In terms of security, all user inputs are sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by escaping HTML special characters. In addition, all database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, this project combines essential web development components such as database connectivity, user interface design, API integration, and security practices to deliver a functional and interactive application
